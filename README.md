# 10PL
10 papers that all PhD students in programming languages ought to know, for some value of 10

What
----

Programming language researchers investigate the analysis, design,
implementation, and evaluation of programming languages. Our goal 
is that the papers come from all of these areas. 

Why
---

A paper makes it on this list if one of us proposes the paper and none of
the others disagrees.

A paper may make it on the list if it is a milestone in the intellectual
history of programming languages, if it is a good paper, and if its ideas
are still good today. 

A paper may make it on the list if it covers an area particularly well. 

A paper may make it on the list if a PhD student in PL should know about
this topic---even if it is outside of the confines of PL. 

A paper on this list may not be *not* essential to obtaining a PhD in
PL. It is unlikely to introduce you to modern ways of dealing with a
topic. It is unlikely to be fashionable. It is improbable that you will
cite it in your dissertation. But, all of us consider it worth your
while. Reading it is good for your soul.
